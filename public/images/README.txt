Place your image files in this folder and update manifest.json to control what appears on the landing page.

Usage:
- hero: filename for the hero image (e.g., hero.jpg)
- portrait: filename for the tall portrait image (e.g., portrait.jpg)
- gallery: array of items (either filenames or { "src": "file.jpg", "caption": "Text" })

After adding files, edit manifest.json accordingly. No code changes required.
